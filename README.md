### Hello Azeroth ğŸ‘‹

<!--

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making things easier for the teams and leaders I support.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning accordion.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the business management operations and best practices for large tech organizations.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with best practices around large companies contributing to open source.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The exercise of trying to identify a fun fact to post on github forced me into a mental spiral of self reflection that I don't have time for right now.  Off to the next meeting!
