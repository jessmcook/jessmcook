### Hello Azeroth 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making things easier for the teams and leaders I support.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning accordion.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the business management operations and best practices for large tech organizations.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with best practices around large companies contributing to open source.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The exercise of trying to identify a fun fact to post on github forced me into a mental spiral of self reflection that I don't have time for right now.  Off to the next meeting!
